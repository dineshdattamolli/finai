# 🧾 **FinAI – AI-Powered Multi-Agent Personal Finance Coach**

**FinAI** is a full-stack **GenAI personal finance assistant** built using a **multi-agent architecture**, **LLM reasoning**, and a clean **Streamlit UI**.
It analyzes income, expenses, and loan data, then generates actionable, personalized financial advice using multiple coordinated AI agents.

This project showcases real-world AI engineering skills across:

* Multi-agent orchestration
* Python backend architecture
* Financial calculations (EMI, budgeting, allocations)
* LLM reasoning + prompt engineering
* Persistent user memory
* Frontend UI development in Streamlit
* Data visualization with Matplotlib

FinAI is designed to help users optimize their monthly budget, repay loans effectively, build savings habits, and receive safe investment guidance — all powered by intelligent agents working together.

# 🚀 **Core Features**

### **1. Multi-Agent AI System**

FinAI uses four specialized AI agents:

* **Data Agent** → Performs numeric analysis (EMI, budgets, savings rate)
* **Advisor Agent** → Gives budget optimization advice
* **Investment Agent** → Provides safe and simple investment guidance
* **Coach Agent** → Combines all insights into a personalized financial action plan

### **2. Financial Intelligence**

* EMI calculations
* Complete monthly budget generation
* Savings rate and spending analysis
* Debt payoff planning (1–20 years)

### **3. Smart LLM-Powered Insights**

* Personalized, human-readable financial recommendations
* “Next month” & “Next 6–12 months” planning
* Concrete, actionable steps

### **4. Clean and Interactive UI (Streamlit)**

* Easy-to-use input sliders & forms
* Responsive layout
* Bar charts for expense vs savings visualization

### **5. Local Memory Storage**

* Saves each user’s financial profile
* Allows reloading previous sessions
